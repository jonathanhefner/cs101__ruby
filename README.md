# CS 101

Algorithms and data structures, implemented in Ruby.

Also -- perhaps as interesting as the algorithms themselves --
property-based unit tests which delineate algorithm invariants.  The
tests are written such that they could be adapted to a
[fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).


## Usage

Run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests.
